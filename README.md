# CoppeliaSim-Mobile-Manipulation

Report Summary
The goal of this project is to implement mobile manipulation using the youBot mobile manipulator, which consists of a mobile base with four Mecanum wheels and a 5R robotic arm. The objective is to successfully control the robot to pick up a block at a specified location, transport it to a desired position, and place it down. This requires generating a reference trajectory for the end-effector, performing odometry as the chassis moves, and implementing feedback control to ensure accurate motion execution.
The project is implemented using MATLAB, where scripts and functions are developed to generate trajectories, compute feedback control, and update the robot's state. The simulation is conducted in CoppeliaSim, with the MATLAB script generating a CSV file containing chassis configurations, joint angles, and wheel angles. This file is then executed in CoppeliaSim to visualize and analyze the physical motion of the robot.
The process begins with trajectory generation, where the TrajectoryGenerator function is executed using the given initial and final configurations of the block. This function computes a reference trajectory for the end-effector. Once the trajectory is generated, the feedback control process is initiated. The FeedbackControl function receives the current and desired end-effector configurations, as well as control gains (Kp, Ki), external force feedback, and the current robot state. It then computes the required wheel and joint velocities to minimize the error between the actual and desired configurations. Additionally, the function outputs the error twist (Xerr), which is used for analyzing the system's performance.
The next step involves updating the robotâ€™s state using the NextState function. The computed wheel and joint velocities, along with the current state, are passed to this function to determine the new chassis configuration and joint angles. This updated state is then fed back into the control loop, ensuring continuous adjustments until the robot successfully completes the task.
In robotic manipulation, singularities occur when the robot's Jacobian matrix loses rank, leading to loss of controllability and infinite or undefined joint velocities. To prevent such issues, the initial joint angles of the robot are carefully selected to avoid all-zero configurations for both the reference trajectory and the actual robot state. In the case of the youBot manipulator, which has a 5R (five revolute joints) robotic arm, an all-zero joint configuration could result in the robot being unable to generate motion in certain directions. To mitigate this risk, nonzero initial joint angles are set for both the reference trajectory and the actual robot state. This choice helps in avoiding near-singular conditions, where even small disturbances in motion could lead to instability or unpredictable movements.
